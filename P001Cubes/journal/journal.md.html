=============================================================
1. What are the differences between the Scene* and shared_ptr<scene> data types in C++?
    + One is pointer and one is reference
2. How does G3D know where the scene files are located?
    + By the atr dataDir in setting when create GApp setting in main(...)
    + Also, dateDir is currently assigned with current working directory that can be changed in Solution properties
3. Why should you to put your initialization code into App::onInit instead 
    of constructor App::App? 
    + The full initialization can be heavy, you want the object is constructed fast before put data into the object
4. What is the call chain that invokes App::onGraphics3D?
    + Contructor -> run -> onRun -> beginRun -> onInit  -> loadScene -> onGraphic -> onGraphic3D
5. Where is the file cube.obj stored on the file system? How did the Scene parser know to load it from there?
    + the specification finally trace to G3D::ArticulatedModel::load 
        where the function loadOBJ(specification) is used.
        first an instance of specification is created with input Any spec, 
        then specification.filename later on got resolved into full path by function
        Any::resolveStringAsFilename, check function System::findDataFile where a list of directory are checked
        String G3D::System::findDataFile: https://casual-effects.com/g3d/G3D10/build/manual/class_g3_d_1_1_system.html#acd234ebe6dde1886a89f9fc832d07953

2024-07-17: Add whitebox
=============================================================
![](2024-07-17__002.jpg)

A model of the Cornell Box that is pictured in Figure 2 created by a combination
of the starter program's scene editing GUI and manual file editing.


![](2024-07-17__001.jpg)

A single, white 1 m3 cube rotated 45ï¿½ about the vertical axis, with center at
(0m, 0m, -2m), created by manually editing a scene file.

2019-03-01: Formatting Notes
=====================================================

This development journal is for you to maintain a log of your project.
It is in [Markdeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/) format. It is
readable as plain text but will have additional nice formatting when loaded
in a web browser.

Put the newest entry at the top of this file, like a blog. Begin the title of
each section with a date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD).

Press *F4* or *F6* in your G3D program to automatically add screenshots and video to 
this development journal.
